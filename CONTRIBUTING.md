# Contributing to Frontend Benchmark

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Frontend Framework Benchmark project!

## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Framework Implementation

1. **Create a new directory** under `implementations/` with your framework name
2. **Follow the specification** in [BENCHMARK_SPEC.md](BENCHMARK_SPEC.md)
3. **Implement the Todo app** with all required features:
   - Add, toggle, and delete todos
   - Filter by All, Active, Completed
   - Display remaining count
   - Pre-populate with 100 todos
   - Use shared CSS from `shared/styles/todo.css`
4. **Create a README** with setup and build instructions
5. **Test thoroughly** to ensure all features work
6. **Build for production** and document bundle sizes

### Framework Implementation Checklist

  - [ ] Toggle completion status
  - [ ] Delete todos
  - [ ] Filter todos (All/Active/Completed)
  - [ ] Display remaining count
  - [ ] 100 pre-populated todos
- [ ] Shared CSS styles used/copied
- [ ] README.md with:
  - [ ] Framework version
  - [ ] Installation instructions
  - [ ] Development server commands
  - [ ] Build commands
  - [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Production build tested
- [ ] Bundle size documented

### Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:
- Framework and version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- Browser and OS information

### Benchmark Results

If you're submitting benchmark results:
1. Use the testing methodology from [BENCHMARK_SPEC.md](BENCHMARK_SPEC.md)
2. Include:
   - Hardware specifications
   - Browser version
   - Testing environment details
   - Raw data in JSON format
3. Add results to `benchmarks/results/`
4. Update [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md) with summary

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style of each framework
- Use framework best practices
- Keep implementations simple and comparable
- Add comments only where necessary for clarity
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/add-framework-name`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Commit with clear messages
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Screenshots of the implementation
   - Bundle size comparison
   - Any notable implementation details

### Guidelines

**DO:**
- Follow the benchmark specification exactly
- Keep implementations comparable
- Document any framework-specific optimizations
- Test on multiple browsers
- Use production builds for measurements

**DON'T:**
- Add unnecessary external dependencies
- Use non-standard optimizations
- Skip required features
- Use different UI/UX from the specification

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/analisaperlengkapan/frontend-benchmark.git
cd frontend-benchmark

# Navigate to a specific implementation
cd implementations/react

# Follow the README in that directory
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Testing Your Changes

Before submitting:

1. **Visual Test**: Run the dev server and manually test all features
2. **Build Test**: Create a production build and verify it works
3. **Bundle Size**: Document the production bundle size
4. **Performance**: Run basic performance tests
5. **Accessibility**: Check basic accessibility with browser DevTools
